# OpenCV-Sudoku-Solver

A Python-based Sudoku solver using OpenCV for image processing and number recognition. This project detects a Sudoku puzzle from an image, extracts the grid, solves the puzzle using a backtracking algorithm, and overlays the solution back onto the original image.

## Features
- Detect and extract Sudoku grids from an image.
- Recognize digits within the grid using OpenCV.
- Solve the puzzle using a backtracking algorithm.
- Overlay the solution onto the original Sudoku image.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harshils2340/OpenCV-Sudoku-Solver.git
   cd OpenCV-Sudoku-Solver
